"""Polling worker that triggers due project reruns on their configured interval.

Interval-based, not cron-based: each project carries repeat_enabled/repeat_interval_value/
repeat_interval_unit/next_run_at, computed by projects_store.py after every pipeline run.
This loop just polls for projects whose next_run_at has passed and starts the same
pipeline path /scrape uses, reusing pipeline_runs.py for the duplicate-run guard.
