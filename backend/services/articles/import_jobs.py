"""Background JSONL import: batched upserts with live progress.

Importing is the mirror of the streaming export, and has the same reason to be
incremental - a project's export carries every article's full text and
embedding, so a restore reads a file far too large to hold in memory or to
finish inside one request. The upload is spooled to a temp file by the route,
then this job walks it line by line, upserting in batches of BATCH_SIZE through
the same save_articles() the pipeline's saver stage uses. Imported articles
therefore get the identical project link, story grouping and idea-cluster
treatment a scraped one does.

Progress is reported the way competitor discovery/analysis report theirs (see
job_runs.JobRegistry): a process-local run the UI polls, carrying counters and
an append-only log. Nothing here is worth resuming after a restart - the upsert
is keyed on url, so a failed import is simply re-run.
