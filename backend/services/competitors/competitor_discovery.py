"""Find who the competitors are, rank them by size, and locate their accounts.

Three stages, deliberately separate:

1. `discover_competitors()` — asks the LLM for the real companies competing with
   the profiled business and shows the raw name list to the user immediately.
   Ranking is by size, because a user comparing themselves to the market cares
   about the incumbents first, and because "prioritise by size" is the only
   ordering that is stable enough to be worth showing as a rank. Live web
   corroboration is *not* run here — a fast list beats a slow one, and most
   suggestions never get tracked, so spending a fetch-plus-search per candidate
   here would mostly be wasted.

2. `verify_competitor()` — runs once a user actually tracks an AI-suggested
   competitor: the same web corroboration `discover_competitors()` used to do
   up front, now spent only on companies the user chose. Catches a hallucinated
   name or dead domain before phase 3 spends an LLM call finding its channels.

3. `discover_accounts()` — resolves each competitor's channels: owned accounts
   (site feed, X, blog, news) plus hashtags and search keywords worth
   monitoring them by. A couple of live web searches ground the LLM call the
   same way `discover_competitors()`'s grounding does, since the model's own
   memory of a smaller or regional competitor's actual handles is exactly
   where it's weakest and most likely to hallucinate. Review/discussion pages
   (Reddit, Trustpilot, Yelp) are found the same grounded way but never asked
   of the model at all — a review-site URL isn't something a model can
   reliably recall, but it's exactly the kind of normally-indexed page search
   finds well, so `_review_candidates()` links the actual search hit directly
   (guarded by a name-overlap check, since everything here still gets linked
   as `valid` with no further confirmation). Every result carries a confidence
   and is pre-approved (`validation_status: "valid"`), so it's linked as a
   scrape source the moment it's discovered — no manual confirmation step.

Search and URL resolution reuse `project_discovery`, so there is one place that
knows how to query the web and normalise a result.
