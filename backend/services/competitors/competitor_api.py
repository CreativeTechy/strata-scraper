"""HTTP surface for the competitor study.

Kept in its own APIRouter rather than appended to main.py: this is a separate
experience from opinion monitoring, and separating the routes is what keeps
the two from tangling as either one grows.

Collection only - a study defines *who* to watch and which channels to
collect from; it draws no conclusions. Findings generation lives in whatever
analyzes the exported articles.

Long-running work (the business-website scrape) runs synchronously and is
expected to take tens of seconds — the UI shows staged progress for it,
matching how the existing project discovery flow behaves. Competitor
discovery is the exception: it runs as a background job (see
discover()/discover_status() below) because it can take minutes once web
corroboration and per-competitor account lookups are added up, well past any
gateway timeout.
