"""Competitors, their accounts, and the link into the existing scrape machinery.

The important design choice here: a validated competitor account becomes a row in
`sources` joined to the project through `project_sources`. That means competitor
scraping is driven by the scraper, pipeline_runs, cancel support and
`projects.repeat_*` scheduler that already exist — there is no second pipeline to
build, schedule, or debug.

Only `valid` accounts are ever linked. A guessed handle that turns out to belong
to someone else would otherwise pull a stranger's activity into a competitor
report, and reports here are read as input to business decisions.
