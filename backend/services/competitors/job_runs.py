"""In-memory registry for one-shot background jobs the user watches live.

Competitor discovery queues a FastAPI BackgroundTask that can run for minutes
- well past any gateway timeout - and streams progress lines the UI polls for
while it runs. This is the bookkeeping that needs: a process-local dict of
runs guarded by one lock, with an append-only log per run.

Deliberately in-process rather than Postgres. These are one-shot steps a user
is sitting in front of, not durable scheduled work like the scrape pipeline
(which does persist, via `pipeline_runs`) - if the backend restarts mid-run
there is nothing worth resuming, the UI just needs to let the user retry.
