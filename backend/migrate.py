"""Forward-only schema migration runner.

Why this exists
---------------
`schema.sql` is mounted into Postgres as `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, which
Postgres executes *only* when the data directory is empty. Every schema change
after the first `docker compose up` therefore reached existing databases only by
someone pasting SQL by hand, and nothing recorded whether they had. This runner
replaces that with an ordered, checksummed, recorded sequence.

Model
-----
- `schema.sql` is version `0001_baseline`. It is idempotent and safe to re-run
  (every statement is `if not exists` / `or replace` / `on conflict do nothing`),
  so there is exactly one code path for all three real situations: a fresh
  volume where initdb already ran it, an existing database that predates this
  runner, and a bare database with no initdb hook at all.
- `migrations/NNNN_name.sql` are the forward migrations, applied in filename
  order, each inside its own transaction.
- `schema_migrations` records version + checksum. A file edited after being
  applied fails loudly instead of silently diverging environments.

Usage
-----
    python migrate.py            # apply pending migrations
    python migrate.py --status   # show applied/pending, apply nothing
    python migrate.py --verify   # exit non-zero if anything is pending/changed
